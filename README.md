# Stock-Trend-Algorithm
This notebook is an experiment that aims to use google trends to track stock sentiment and make trades. Research paper is attached. 

This code has since been changed, refactored, and migrated away from Jupyter to increase mutability, execution speed, and address certain mistakes. I decided to uplaod the older version here on Github because... 
1. I occasionally use the new algorithm to assist with trades and want to maintain any market advantage I have.
2. The jupyter notebook makes it easier to follow my thought process, visualize charts, and understand what's going on.
3. I like to highlight my mistakes because those are my greatest learning opportunities.  

Can you find the main mistake I made?
